# writeups
You can find some writeups for CTF challenges I have completed. If you have any question about my solution, or have a better solution to these challenges that you are willing to share, email me at return2pwn@gmail.com

Each folder will include the following:
  1. Detailed word document on the steps I took during the challenge, with screenshots.
  2. All challenge files (binary, my script to solve it, libc file, etc)
