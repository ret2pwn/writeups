# writeups
You can find some writeups for CTF challenges I have completed.
Each folder will include the following:
  1. Detailed word document on the steps I took during the challenge, with screenshots.
  2. The exploit script I wrote to solve the challenge
  3. Another folder with the files needed to make a docker image for the challenge, and start a container.
