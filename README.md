# writeups
You can find some writeups for CTF challenges I have completed here, as well as some resources for getting started in the categories I have writeups for. I am also still learning, so if you have any suggestions for me feel free to email me at return2pwn@gmail.com!

Each folder will include the following:
  1. Detailed word document on the steps I took during the challenge, with screenshots.
  2. All challenge files (challenge binary/script, my exploit script to solve it)
